# smiley

A fun side project to learn how to use CoreML: an iOS app that will show you cute dog or cat videos and uses machine learning to analyze your facial expression. See how long you can watch the video before smiling! 

Heavily inspired by a project from BuzzFeed hack week


### To do:

- [ ] Refactor MainViewController (it is quite the mess :sweat_smile:)
- [ ] More accurate face detection
- [ ] Train/add facial expression model
- [ ] Add video timer
- [x] Use user auth token to fetch videos instead of hard coded video URLs
- [x] Add cat video support
